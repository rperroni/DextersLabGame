# DextersLabGame

This is a college project. The "utiles.h" and "utiles.o" files were provided by the teachers, since at the moment we - the students -  did not have enought knowledge to create some of the functions required to build the levels of the game.
In the future I will add an english version of the game, since this was in spanish as a request of the teachers.
